The implementation of the Feature Weighted Linear Stacking is in the file 'fwls.py'. To run the file with default arguments
run 'make all'. To get help run 'make help'. To change deafult arguments run 'python fwls.py -L <value> -C <value> -N <value>'.
The arguments P and number of algorithms can not be changed as they are only three base algorithms defined in the code.
